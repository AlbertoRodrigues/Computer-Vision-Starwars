# Computer Vision Project

#### This is my first computer vision, necessary to enter the computer vision area of ​​the Artificial Intelligence group at the University of São Paulo called Turing USP. Through it I learned several tools to deal with deep learning and image processing.

## The main concepts learned were:

1. Opencv
2. Pytorch
3. Convolutional Neural Network
4. Transfer Learning

#### Well, no more stalling and let's get down to business! The idea here is to get hands-on with a Computer Vision project to learn the main concepts as the project progresses. Along with this document, I'll leave several links and materials that I used to apply the project's tools.

## Main libraries used in the project:

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. OpenCV
5. Pillow
6. PyTorch
7. Sklearn
8. Scikit-image
9. glob
10. the

#### PyTorch was the main library used for deep learning while the others were mainly in image manipulation and image files.

## There are two parts to this project:

1. Image manipulations

#### In this step, I showed my mastery over the images: reading, manipulating the RGB bands and even applying transformations over the images.

2. Deep Learning

#### Now comes the biggest challenge in this project, which is deep learning. Widely known in the data world, where it uses the power of convolution!
